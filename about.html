         <p>The Magic the Gathering Spellslingers Club is a playgroup that was founded in 2016.
            The club was started by four original members who are still active today.
            The main format of the club is Commander
            but other constructed and limited formats are also incorporated into meetups.
            As a playgroup, we sometimes attend MTG events together; both
            at local game stores as well as non-local events that require travel.
            As a club, our objectives are to provide a positive communication channel to discuss the game we love
            and to provide a platform for MTG enthusiasts to meet and play Magic The Gathering.
            </p>
